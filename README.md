# emited-current-ML-project
The project was utilized to predict photocurrent of AlGaN nanoarrays.
The execution logic of this project is as follows:
data distribution.py -> 
correlation_ec.py -> 
CNN_BayesianOptimization.py -> 
CNN_ec.py -> 
Transfer learning.py -> 
CNN Interpretability.py

The project employs a small-scale physical model for pre-training, followed by transfer learning to new scales. 
The physical model is based on my previous work, which can be referenced here:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2025.162927
